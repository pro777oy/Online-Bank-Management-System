# Online-Bank-Management-System
The name of my project is the Online Bank Management system. The main purpose of the project is to create online banking for all types of bank management systems. 

This is our UML diagram. Here we can see there are 4 types of class relationships. 
1.	A Bank “has–a” number of Branches which is an composition, one–to–many
2.	A Branch “has–a” number of accounts which is an aggregation, one–to–many
From the class Account, two classes have inherited, namely, Savings Account and Checking Account.
3.	A Customer can have one Checking Account which is an association, one–to–one
4.	A Customer can have one Savings Account which is an association, one–to–one
